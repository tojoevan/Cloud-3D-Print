# Cloud-3D-Print
The goal of this project is to provide a system that will allow multiple user submit 3D print jobs from different locations on a large campus network. The project is meant to abstract the printing process form the user freeing up the time managing a 3D printer and allowing to be productive in other areas of their projects.
